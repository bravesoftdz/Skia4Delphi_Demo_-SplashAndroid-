#Splash Demo

This demo shows a technique how to show a splash screen, which isn't bound to the actual main form - and works for Firemonkey app - which have a delayed form creation system on non desktop platforms.

It also features a great Lottie animation, which displays just beautifully through Skia's rendering engine.

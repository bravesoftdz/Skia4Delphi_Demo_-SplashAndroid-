# Splash Demo

This demo shows a technique how to display a splash screen, which isn't bound to the actual main form - and still works for Firemonkey apps. FMX apps have a delayed form creation system on non desktop platforms.

It also features a great Lottie animation, which displays just beautifully through Skia's rendering engine.
